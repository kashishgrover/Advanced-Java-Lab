Develop a complete login application. The application will ask the user to input username and password and to check the existence of this user in the database. The username should consist of at least one symbol and one number.  While entering the password, it should be masked with * or . symbol. There should be provision for the user to register for the particular application. If the user exists,  the retrieve the data based on the query. If not registered, display "Sorry, you are not registered.". The above program has to be implemented to keep track of students, faculties and the administrators in a college. The privileges given for each type of user should vary based on their designation.
